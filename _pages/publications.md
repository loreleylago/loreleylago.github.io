## Chukchi Sea, Pacific Arctic

During my current postdoc at WHOI in [Bob Pickart](https://rpickart.whoi.edu/)'s lab , I'm studying the Chukchi Sea circulation through in situ hydrography and ADCP measurements, as well as with renanalysis outputs. I also carry out particle advection analysis in an interdisciplinary approach to understand the summer harmful algal blooms being detected there. We just submitted the 1st paper to JGR: Oceans, stay tuned for updates! :)

One cool reault I can share is:  The Bering Strait heat transport affects the bottom temperature further north, where these toxic phytoplankton species rest in the bottom of the ocean, affecting the moment of the year when they “wake up” and form these local blooms.



## Southestern Atlanctic Ocean

During my master PhD, I was advised by scientists I admire deeply ([Martin Saraceno](https://www.cima.fcen.uba.ar/~saraceno/CV_saraceno/Welcome.html), [Alberto Piola](https://scholar.google.com.ar/citations?user=iWZi6o8AAAAJ&hl=en) y [Patricia Martos](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Patricia-Martos)). They guided me in the analysis of the longest time series of velocity direct observations ever acquired in the Argentine basin, embedded in the full-of-exciting-features Southwestern Atlantic Ocean. The core objective was to analyze the continental shelf circulation and identify the forcing responsible for the variability observed.
During this period, I learned to acquire, process and analyze in-situ data, as well as to work with reanalysis outputs and satellite altimetry products.

### Here a some of my favorite results:

[Lago et al. (2019). On the wind contribution to the variability of ocean currents over wide continental shelves: a case study on the northern Argentine continental shelf. JGR:Oceans.](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019JC015105)

* Large‐scale wind stress patterns dominate the temporal variability of the in situ currents at all depths.

* The along-shore wind stress generates cross‐shore pressure gradients than induce a geostrophic response in the along-shore currents.

* The wind also generates frequent flow reversals that are relevant to the local ecosystem, redistributing nutrients availability for the small pelagic species found in the region. In the shelf interior, velocities changed from -60 to 70 cm/s in only 8 days. In that period the de-tided TG increased the level 1.4 m.
  

[Lago et al. (2021). Volume transport variability on the northern argentine continental shelf from in situ and satellite altimetry data. JGR:Oceans.](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2020JC016813)

* The mean in situ along-shore de-tided transport is 2.65 Sv to the northeast and presents large variability, with a peak-to-peak range of 16 Sv, way larger than eported in previous studies.

[Lago et al. (2017). Improved sea surface height from satellite altimetry in coastal zones: A case study in Southern Patagonia. IEEE.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7919182)

During my master I did a technical analysis of the performance of coastal satellite altimetry raw products near the coast of Argentina. The most valuable knowledge from this work for me was to learn what satellite altimetry works and how accurate it can be when the most suitable corrections are chosen.
